## How to Use Closet View

### 1. Toggle to Closet View

Click the **👔 CLOSET VIEW** button in the control panel (top left).

The button will change to **📇 CARD VIEW** when you're in closet mode.

### 2. View Your Clothes

Your items are displayed as **hanging clothes** on a retro neon closet rod:

- **👕 Shirts** - All shirts grouped together
- **👖 Pants** - All pants grouped together
- **👟 Shoes** - All shoes grouped together
- **🧥 Jackets** - All jackets/hoodies grouped together
- **👔 Polos** - All polos grouped together

Each item shows:
- **Hanger ID** (big pixel font)
- **Clothing emoji** (type indicator)
- **Price tag** ($XX)
- **Status dot** (🟢 Active, 🟡 Inactive, 🔴 SOLD)

### 3. Drag & Drop to Reorganize

**Want to move a shirt from Hanger 5 to Hanger 12?**

1. Click and hold the item you want to move
2. Drag it over another item
3. Release to swap their hanger IDs

✅ **Auto-saves immediately!** Your change is permanent.

### 4. Hover for Sway Animation

Hover over any item to see it **sway like real clothes!**

This subtle animation makes the closet feel alive.

### 5. Click to Edit

Click any item to open the **edit modal** where you can:
- Update price
- Change status
- Edit details
- Upload photos
- Delete item

## Smart Organization

### Automatic Grouping

Items are **automatically grouped by TYPE**:

1. **Shirts Section** → All shirts sorted by hanger ID
2. **Pants Section** → All pants sorted by hanger ID
3. **Shoes Section** → All shoes sorted by hanger ID
4. **Accessories** → All accessories sorted by hanger ID

### Hanger ID Sorting

Within each type section, items are sorted **numerically by hanger ID**:

```
Shirts:
H1 → H3 → H5 → H7 → H9

Pants:
H2 → H4 → H6 → H8
```

This mimics how you'd organize a real closet!

---

## Status Indicators

### Color-Coded Dots

- **🟢 Green** = Active (for sale)
- **🟡 Yellow** = Inactive (not listed)
- **🔴 Red** = SOLD (completed sale)

The colored dot appears in the **top-left corner** of each hanger.

### Price Tags

White price tags show the **selling price** and hang off the bottom-right of each item.

---

## Drag-and-Drop Rules

### What Happens When You Drag

1. **Dragged item** becomes semi-transparent and tilts
2. **Target item** highlights with cyan border
3. **On drop**: Hanger IDs swap instantly
4. **Auto-save**: Changes saved to localStorage
5. **Re-render**: Closet updates with new order

### Example Swap

**Before:**
- Item A on Hanger 5
- Item B on Hanger 12

**After dragging A onto B:**
- Item A now on Hanger 12 ✅
- Item B now on Hanger 5 ✅

### Data Safety

- ✅ All 79 items preserved
- ✅ Auto-saves after every swap
- ✅ No data loss possible
- ✅ Undo by swapping back

2. Hold for 0.5 seconds before dragging
3. Try using Chrome/Edge (best support)

### "Items not saving"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled
3. Make sure you're logged in

3. Verify no JavaScript errors in console

## Pro Tips

### Organize by Color

Use drag-and-drop to **group similar colors** within each type:

```
Shirts:
H1 (red) → H2 (red) → H3 (blue) → H4 (blue)
```

### Organize by Price

Move **high-value items** to lower hanger numbers for easy access:

```
H1 ($120) → H2 ($95) → H3 ($80)
```

### Organize by Season

Keep **current season** items at the start:

```
Summer:
H1 (t-shirt) → H2 (shorts) → H3 (sandals)

Winter:
H50 (jacket) → H51 (sweater) → H52 (boots)
```
